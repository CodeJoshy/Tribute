      <h2>“My dad was an incredible man. He provided for his family and made sure his children had the guidance they needed. I am grateful for my dad and I miss him every day.”<br>

      <p>

“Today I am remembering my dad and the great memories we shared. He was one of a kind and my best friend. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think of him and smile.”<br></p>

“My father was my biggest fan and my greatest role model. I could call him at any time and he always has a solution to my problem. Life is different without him, but I am grateful I got to call him my dad.”<p>

<ol><i>

“When I remember my dad, I smile each time. He was a jokester and he made us all laugh. He taught me not to take life too seriously. He was always in good spirits, even until the day he died.” </ol></i>

“My dad was my hero. He was the most courageous and resourceful man. I never questioned if he loved or cared for me because he made it so obvious. I still feel him with me each day and I am living life for the both of us now.”
